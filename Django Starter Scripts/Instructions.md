# How To Use
You must have uv installed. If you do not already have it, installation instructions can be found [HERE](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#pypi)  

For either file, before running you must give it execution permissions by running ```chmod +x <filename>```

To install Django without Tailwind or daisyUI, run ```./django.sh <directory>```  
To install with Tailwind and daisyUI, run ```./tailwind.sh <directory>```
